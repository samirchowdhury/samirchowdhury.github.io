I am a sixth year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at The Ohio State University. My advisor is Facundo MÃ©moli. On this site, I will periodically post information pertaining to my research and teaching.

My current research interest is in topological and geometric data analysis, particularly in the setting of unsupervised learning.

You can reach me via email by writing "chowdhury.57" and then adding "@osu.edu".

**New**: Katie Ritchey and I are organizing a graduate student lunch-and-learn seminar in 2018-2019. The aim is to create a friendly and welcoming environment for graduate students in topology, geometry, and their applications to give practice talks and also to meet other students and postdocs.
