I am a sixth year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at The Ohio State University. My advisor is Facundo MÃ©moli. Prior to OSU, I completed my undergraduate degree at Tufts University (B.S. Engineering Science).

My current research interest is in topological and geometric data analysis, particularly in the setting of unsupervised learning.

You can reach me via email by writing "chowdhury.57" and then adding "@osu.edu".

**New**: I'll be a coorganizer for GTDAML2019 (official title: First Midwest Graduate Student Conference: Geometry and Topology meet Data Analysis and Machine Learning). The aim of this conference is to bring together graduate students interested in the preceding topics to OSU over the first weekend of June to discuss their work, present posters, and give research/expository talks. Please see <https://tgda.osu.edu/gtdaml2019/> for more details!



**New**: Katie Ritchey and I are organizing a graduate student lunch-and-learn seminar in 2018-2019. The aim is to create a friendly and welcoming environment for graduate students in topology, geometry, and their applications to give practice talks and also to meet other students and postdocs.
