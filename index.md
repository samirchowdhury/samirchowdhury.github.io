excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, working with Manish Saggar at the Brain Dynamics Lab. 
Recently I completed my PhD in the Department of Mathematics at The Ohio State University, under the supervision of Facundo MÃ©moli.

Prior to OSU, I completed my undergraduate degree at Tufts University (B.S. Engineering Science).

My research is in applied topology and geometry, and in developing the foundations of such methods in neuroimaging.
