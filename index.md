excerpt: "About Me..."
---

Starting June 2022, I will be a senior computer vision engineer at Bear Flag Robotics. Here I will be working on vision problems related to autonomous tractor deployment. 

Prior to BFR, I was a machine learning engineer at Revelio Labs. Going further back, I was a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University from 2019-2021, working with Manish Saggar at the Brain Dynamics Lab. 

Prior to Stanford, I completed my PhD in the Department of Mathematics at The Ohio State University in May 2019, under the supervision of Facundo Mémoli. I completed my undergraduate degree at Tufts University (B.S. Engineering Science).

My research is in applied topology and geometry, and in developing foundational applications of such methods in the empirical sciences (such as neuroimaging).
